## News

### An improved queue/partition scheme for Ceres

For a variety of reasons, Ceres has accumulated many queues/partitions over the years, now numbering well over a dozen. Having so many partitions can make Ceres challenging to use, especially for new users. (If you are not sure what "partition" or "queue" means on a supercomputer, check out [our user guides]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/use/partitions-queues) for more information!) During Ceres' February 2025 maintenance, we added a new partition, named "ceres", that greatly simplifies running compute jobs on Ceres. **The bottom line is that you should now be able to submit nearly all jobs to the "ceres" partition and effectively ignore the remaining partitions.** In the future, some or all of these "legacy" partitions will be removed.  

The new "ceres" partition includes all community (that is, non-priority) nodes, and we expect that use of this new partition will ultimately result in an improved user experience, shorter wait times, better cluster utilization, and a more similar user experience on Ceres and Atlas. Please note, however, that the new "ceres" partition has a default job time of 2 hours. This will help avoid long wait times in the queue due to implicitly requesting far more time than a job needs, but it also means that if your job requires more than 2 hours, you will need to explicitly request more time. Please see the [SCINet website for more information.]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/use/partitions-queues) 

### New image annotation software on Atlas

You can now easily create computer vision model training datasets directly on Atlas without needing to transfer image files to and from local laptops or workstations for annotation. [Labelme](https://labelme.io/), an image annotation application, is now available as an interactive app on [Open OnDemand on Atlas](https://atlas-ood.hpc.msstate.edu/). Labelme supports a variety of annotation types, including bounding boxes and custom polygons, and it also supports automated and semi-automated annotation using pretrained, general computer vision AI models.

*Figure 2. Labelme running on Atlas.*


### Would you like to help test SCINet's new GPU nodes? 

Usage of SCINet's GPU resources has increased dramatically over the past few years, and SCINet is expanding its GPU offerings to ensure we can continue to meet demand. We've recently added 12 new GPU nodes to Atlas, each with 4 [NVIDIA L40S](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/l40s/) GPUs. We are looking for SCINet users to help us test these new GPU nodes before they go into full production! We'll ask early testers to try running their usual GPU workloads on the new nodes and provide feedback about their experience. If you'd like to help, please contact Brian Stucky ([brian.stucky@usda.gov](mailto:brian.stucky@usda.gov)) or Heather Savoy ([heather.savoy@usda.gov](mailto:heather.savoy@usda.gov)), and thank you! 

### AI-COE/SCINet internships update 

We are pleased to announce that we have matched 15 graduate student interns with ARS AI-COE/SCINet internship opportunities based on the mutual interests of each student and their prospective mentor. These interns will work on a wide variety of research projects, all of which include significant artificial intelligence/machine learning or data science components. Twelve of these internships will begin this summer; three interns are already working with ARS mentors in spring internships. Many thanks to the 26 ARS scientists who applied to serve as AI-COE/SCINet graduate student internship mentors in 2025!  

We are again planning a virtual internships research symposium in the fall, and we expect to announce details this summer! 

### AI Innovation Fund and SCINet/AI-COE postdoctoral fellowship mentor proposals update 

If you submitted a proposal last December for an AI Innovation Fund award or to serve as a SCINet/AI-COE postdoctoral fellowship mentor, you have undoubtedly been wondering about the status of your proposal. We are pausing both of these programs at this time. We plan to re-evaluate later this year and will provide additional updates if we are able to move forward with either program. 



## Working Group Updates

[SCINet working groups]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/working-groups/) (WGs) support ARS researchers and their collaborators in using scientific computing methods and SCINet computational resources in their research. Common WG activities include hosting recurring virtual meetings and webinars, organizing training events, and participating in collaborative research or software development projects.  

### Translational Omics Working Group  

The Translational Omics Working Group is hosting an upcoming webinar:  
**Improving Production Traits in Poultry through Genome Editing**
* Thursday, May 8, 2025, 1 PM ET 
* Paula Chen, Ph.D., U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Research Service, Plant Genetics Research Unit, Columbia, MO 65211 

For more information or to join the working group's email list, please contact George Liu ([George.Liu@usda.gov](mailto:George.Liu@usda.gov)) or Wenli Li ([Wenli.Li@usda.gov](mailto:Wenli.Li@usda.gov))  

### Protein Function and Phenotype Prediction Working Group 

Protein structure prediction resources continue to expand on the SCINet clusters!  

AlphaFold 3 is now available on both the Ceres and Atlas clusters! Special thanks to the SCINet Virtual Research Support Core for making this possible. [Instructions for running AlphaFold 3 on SCINet can be found in the SCINet guide.]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/application/alphafold3)  

In addition to AlphaFold 3, SCINet has also introduced user-friendly modules for several other leading protein structure prediction tools, including AlphaFold 2, ESMFold, and OmegaFold. [Training materials for running AlphaFold 2, ESMFold, and OmegaFold on SCINet are available here]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/2024-ai-user-forum/21-protein-structure). Additional tools, such as Boltz-1, have been successfully deployed on the Atlas GPU nodes. 

Our working group is benchmarking these tools, and the results will be published soon. The figure below shows a preview of the comparisons between AlphaFold 2 and AlphaFold 3 on a maize protein dataset. Early findings suggest that AlphaFold 3 makes predictions substantially faster, effectively handles diverse biomolecular complexes (proteins, DNA, and ligands), and has only a slight reduction in prediction accuracy compared to the previous version.

## Training

### Training workshops

#### Foundations in bioinformatics 

Lead(s): Genome Informatics Facility at Iowa State University and SCINet Office 

Starting in April, the SCINet Office is offering a series of workshops to help ARS researchers develop practical skills for using bioinformatics in their research. The workshops in this series are designed to provide a thorough introduction to modern bioinformatics concepts, techniques, and best practices. Some of the workshops in the series were originally developed for, and offered at, the Forum on AI Applications to USDA Science in College Station, TX in 2024. We are offering them as virtual workshops in 2025, with expanded content and more opportunities for hands-on practice.  

Series Outline:   
* April 15, 2025, 1-4 PM ET: [Introduction to modern bioinformatics](https://scinet.usda.gov/events/2025-04-15-intro) 
* April 17, 2025, 1-5 PM ET: [Introduction to HPC environments and project management and organization](https://scinet.usda.gov/events/2025-04-17-environments)
* April 29, 2025, 1-5 PM ET: [Data preparation and quality assessment in genome assembly](https://scinet.usda.gov/events/2025-04-29-data) 
* May 1, 2025, 1-5 PM ET: [Genome assembly validation and improvement](https://scinet.usda.gov/events/2025-05-01-validation)

#### From reads to variants: a pipeline for variant calling using DeepVariant  

June 3, 2025, 1-5 PM ET  

Lead(s): Sheina Sim (ARS Research Biologist), Craig Carlson (ARS Research Geneticist), and Haley Arnold (SCINet/AI-COE fellow)  

DeepVariant is a DNA sequence variant caller that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to call genotypes relative to a reference genome assembly. In this workshop, we will discuss a workflow for calling variants from whole-genome data for multiple individuals. This workflow involves trimming and filtering raw reads, mapping them to a reference assembly, calling variants for each individual, merging the variants of all individuals into a single variant call format file (.vcf), and filtering the resulting variant file. We will guide participants through this pipeline step by step, providing generalized commands for each phase of the process, as well as strategies for optimizing cluster usage and reducing compute time. The final product will be a .vcf containing variants for all individuals which can be used for downstream analyses, along with a solid understanding of performing variant detection using DeepVariant. 

If you did not have a chance to attend this workshop at the 2024 Forum on AI Applications to USDA Science, please join us!

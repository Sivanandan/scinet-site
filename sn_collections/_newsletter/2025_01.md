## News

### AlphaFold 3 Available on SCINet Clusters

The AlphaFold 3 software, databases, and model weights are now available on both Ceres and Atlas! To learn more about how to use AlphaFold 3 on SCINet clusters, please see [instructions here](/guides/application/alphafold3).

Due to the AlphaFold 3 terms of use, SCINet users will first need to fill out the [SCINet AlphaFold 3 Access Request form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=5zZb7e4BvE6GfuA8-g1Gl3GkFOboG8xDvkxEUNoSEg1UQUZBMU5QWDlNSE5ST0ZOUU9ZUFRWQUxPNy4u) before using AlphFold 3 on SCINet’s supercomputers. This form allows users to affirm their agreement with the AlphaFold 3 Model Parameters Terms of Use, the AlphaFold 3 Output Terms of Use, and the AlphaFold 3 Model Parameters Prohibited Use Policy and should take less than 5 minutes to complete.

### SCINet Login Improvements

There have been three recent improvements to SCINet logins that further streamline users’ access to SCINet computational resources:

* **Streamlined web-based login**: SCINet users will no longer see the SCINet login page that asks for a username and password when they access SCINet systems. Instead, SCINet logins will immediately redirect to USDA’s eAuthentication (eAuth) site, at which point they will continue to authenticate as usual using either their LincPass/AltLinc card or Login.gov credentials. Please note that *how* a user logs in to SCINet will not change. The only thing that will change is eliminating the login page and button click that are no longer necessary.
* **Simplified Globus login**: SCINet users can now log in to Globus using their SCINet accounts like any other web-based SCINet access (previously, logging in to Globus required ORCiD credentials). When logging into Globus.org, you can select ‘SCINet - ARS/USDA’ in the existing organizational login dropdown menu.
* **LincPass login for café machines**: The SCINet café machines offer high-speed data transfer capabilities to and from SCINet’s supercomputers and data storage infrastructure. These machines have been updated to require a LincPass for logging on to the machines. To learn more about the SCINet café machines, please see the [User Tip article](#user-tip) below.

## Training

### Machine Learning/AI Workshop Series  

Starting next month, the SCINet Office will be offering a series of workshops to help ARS researchers develop practical skills for using machine learning/artificial intelligence in their research. These workshops were originally developed for, and offered at, the Forum on AI Applications to USDA Science in College Station, TX in 2024. We are offering them as virtual workshops in 2025, with expanded content and more opportunities for hands-on practice.

**Series Outline:**

* **Feb 10, 12, 14 1-4 PM ET: An introduction to machine learning for science**
  * Machine learning underlies the vast majority of modern AI methods, including the ever-expanding applications of deep learning and generative AI. This workshop will give participants a hands-on introduction to the basic concepts and techniques needed to understand machine learning and to apply machine learning methods to scientific research. 
* **March 11 & 13 1-4:30 PM ET: Computer vision I: Introduction and image classification**
  * This workshop will teach participants the concepts and tools they need to begin applying modern, deep learning-based computer vision methods to their own scientific research. This will be an interactive, hands-on workshop that will offer plenty of opportunities for practice and experiential learning. By the end of the session, participants will have trained and evaluated a state-of-the-art image classification model on a custom image dataset. 
* **March 17 & 19 1-4:30 PM ET: Computer vision II: Object detection and instance segmentation**
  * In this workshop, participants will learn the key concepts and techniques needed to use modern, deep learning-based computer vision methods for object detection and semantic segmentation. Learners will practice training and evaluating state-of-the-art computer vision models on custom image datasets. This workshop is intended as a continuation of “Computer vision I: introduction and image classification”, but participants do not need to take the earlier workshop if they already have a basic knowledge of machine learning and computer vision concepts.  

If you did not have a chance to attend these workshops at the 2024 Forum on AI Applications to USDA Science, please join us!

#### 2024 Forum on AI Applications to USDA Science Workshops Report

The 2024 Forum on AI Applications to USDA Science, held on November 19-21, 2024, in College Station, TX, brought together USDA researchers and collaborators to explore the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in advancing scientific research. The SCINet Office, in collaboration with ARS researchers, the National Agricultural Library, and the Genome Informatics Facility at Iowa State University, hosted 10 hands-on training workshops during the Forum (November 20 and 21, 2024). These workshops were all designed to provide researchers with practical skills for applying AI to their research.  

In preparation for the Forum, the SCINet Office collaborated with the Genome Informatics Facility at Iowa State University and the Research Computing team at the University of Florida to offer two pre-Forum workshops:  

* [Introduction to the Command line and Slurm](/events/2024-11-13-intro-slurm#introduction-to-the-command-line-and-slurm) (Nov 13, 2024)  
* [Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks and Python](/events/2024-11-14-intro-python#introduction-to-jupyter-notebooks-and-python) (Nov 14, 2024) 

These pre-Forum workshops taught participants the foundational computing and programming skills needed to actively participate in the more advanced training workshops at the Forum.

The 10 training workshops taught at the Forum covered a wide range of applications for AI in scientific research (for a detailed summary, please click on the workshops of interest):

### SCINet User Tip
**High speed data transfer with SCINet-X**

More than 60 ARS locations now have a dedicated, high-speed [SCINet-X connection](/news/scinet-x)(see Figure 1 below).  If you are at one of these locations (and chances are good that you are), you might have heard about the new SCINet connection or the "café machine" installed along with it, but you might be wondering what they are for and how to use them. If so, we hope this user tip will help!

Here are the most important things to know:

* The café machine provides access to the dedicated, high-speed SCINet connection.
* The café machine and high-speed connection are intended for transferring very large datasets to and from SCINet’s supercomputers and long-term storage system.
* You do *not* need to use the café machine to use SCINet's computing systems. Computing work should be done from your regular workstation or laptop, just as before.
* We recommend using an external hard drive to move data to the café machine for transfer to SCINet systems. At minimum, the external drive should support the USB 3.0 standard to ensure sufficient data throughput.
* Data transfers should be done using Globus, which will require you to install Globus Connect Personal on your account on the café machine.
*Bitlocker-encrypted external hard drives can be accessed on the café machine using software called "dislocker".

Questions about using the café machines or SCINet-X connections should be directed to the VRSC at [scinet_vrsc@usda.gov](mailto:scinet_vrsc@usda.gov).

Again, the café machines are neither required, nor intended, for doing computational tasks on SCINet. They should only be used for the purpose of transferring very large datasets. However, if you generate large-scale data, your SCINet-X connection will allow you to spend more time analyzing your data and a lot less time waiting to move it from one place to another!

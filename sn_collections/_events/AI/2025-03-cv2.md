In this workshop, participants will learn the key concepts and techniques needed to use modern, deep learning-based computer vision methods for object detection and instance segmentation. Learners will practice training and evaluating state-of-the-art computer vision models on custom image datasets. <!--excerpt-->

## Tutorial setup instruction

Steps to prepare for the tutorial:

1. **Login to Atlas Open OnDemand** at [https://atlas-ood.hpc.msstate.edu/](https://atlas-ood.hpc.msstate.edu/). For more information on login procedures for web-based SCINet access, see the [SCINet access user guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guides/access/web-based-login). If it is the first day of the workshop, go to step 2. For the second day of the workshop, go to step 7.

1. **Open a command-line session** by clicking on "Clusters" -> "Atlas Shell Access" on the top menu. This will open a new tab with a command-line session on Atlas's login node.

1. **Request resources on a compute node** by running the following command: 

    {:.copy-code}
    ```bash
srun -A scinet_workshop1 -t 00:30:00 -n 1 --mem 8G --pty bash 
```
    {% include reservation-alert project="scinet_workshop1" %}

1. **Create and/or update your workshop working directory** and copy the tutorial materials into it by running the following commands. Note: you do not have to edit the commands with your username as it will be determined by the `$USER` variable. 

    {:.copy-code}
    ```bash
mkdir -p /90daydata/shared/$USER/computer_vision2
cd /90daydata/shared/$USER/computer_vision2
cp /project/scinet_workshop1/computer_vision2/cv_2-object_detection.ipynb .
cp /project/scinet_workshop1/computer_vision2/*.py .
```

1. **Setup the kernel for JupyterLab.** You will create a kernel called *computer_vision_2_env* to access from JupyterLab Server. Run the following commands to activate the workshop's virtual environment and create a new kernelspec from it:

    {:.copy-code}
    ```bash
source /project/scinet_workshop1/computer_vision2/computer_vision_2_env/bin/activate
ipython kernel install --name "computer_vision_2_env" --user
```

1. **Stop the interactive job** on the compute node by running the command:

    {:.copy-code}
    ```bash
exit
```

1. **Launch a JupyterLab Server session.** Under the *Interactive Apps* menu, select *JupyterLab Server*. Specify the following input values on the page:

    * Account: scinet_workshop1
    * Partition: gpu-a100-mig7
    * QOS: normal 14-00:00:00
    * Number of hours: 4
    * Number of nodes: 1
    * Number of tasks: 3
    * Additional Slurm Parameters: 
        
        {: .copy-code }
        ```
--reservation=cv2_workshop --gres=gpu:1 --mem=32G --ntasks-per-node=3
```
        {% include reservation-alert reservation="cv2_workshop" %}
    * Working Directory: 
        
        {: .copy-code }
        ```
/90daydata/shared/${USER}/computer_vision2
```
  
    Click *Launch*. The screen will update to the *Interactive Sessions* page. When your Jupyter session is ready, the top card will update from *Queued* to *Running* and a *Connect to JupyterLab Server* button will appear. Click *Connect to JupyterLab Server*.

1. **If this is the first day**, then follow along with the notebook available in JupyterLab. **If this is the second day**, open up a terminal in JupyterLab and run the following command to retrieve the two notebooks and updated script for the day:

    {:.copy-code}
    ```bash
cd /90daydata/shared/${USER}/computer_vision2
cp /project/scinet_workshop1/computer_vision2/cv_2-segmentation.ipynb .
cp /project/scinet_workshop1/computer_vision2/cv_2-sheep.ipynb .
cp /project/scinet_workshop1/computer_vision2/yolo_utils.py .
```
  
1. **Open the `cv_2-segmentation.ipynb` notebook.**

1. **Select the `computer_vision_2_env` kernel** for the notebook.
